# Playground Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Playground is a personal project aimed at showcasing my expertise in building React components, testing them using React Testing Library (RTL), and documenting them with Storybook. Additionally, this project is deployed using Vercel for easy access and demonstration.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **React (Vite)** – Fast and lightweight React development environment.
- **Storybook** – Component-driven development for building and testing UI components.
- **SCSS** – Modular and maintainable styling with advanced CSS features.
- **React Testing Library (RTL)** – Ensuring component reliability through unit and integration tests.
- **Vercel** – Hosting and deploying the project efficiently.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Setting Up the Project
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

#### **Install Vite** (if not installed already)
```sh
npm create vite@latest playground --template react
```
OR using Yarn:
```sh
yarn create vite@latest playground --template react
```

#### **Navigate into the Project Folder**
```sh
cd playground
```

#### **Install Dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```
OR using Yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

### 2️⃣ Running the Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite dev server, and you can access your app at `http://localhost:5173/`

### 3️⃣ Running Storybook
```sh
npm run storybook
```
Storybook will open in your browser, allowing you to visualize and test your components in isolation.

### 4️⃣ Running Tests (React Testing Library)
```sh
npm run test
```
Runs all unit and integration tests to validate component behavior.

## 📤 Deployment
The project is hosted on **Vercel**. To manually trigger a deployment, run:
```sh
vercel --prod
```

Alternatively, if connected to GitHub, pushing changes to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.

## 📚 Additional Information
- Ensure **SCSS** files are properly structured for modular styling.
- Use **Storybook** to visualize and document each component.
- Write comprehensive tests using **React Testing Library** to maintain reliability.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Improve test coverage.
- Optimize component performance.
- Add some relevant UI states like hovers to buttons
- Add more reusable UI components.
